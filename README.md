# 👋 Hi, I'm Alp 

I'm a **Technical Game Developer** and **Data Enthusiast** passionate about **game mechanics, AI, and interactive technologies**. My work spans from **building immersive Unity experiences** to **developing AI and machine learning models** for simulations and data-driven applications.  

## 🔥 What I Do  

### 🎮 Game Development (Unity, Unreal Engine, C#)  
- Designed and developed **3C mechanics** (Character, Camera, Controls).  
- Implemented **custom shaders** for unique visual effects.  
- Integrated **gesture-based interactions** using **Arduino and machine learning**.  
- Built complex **game mechanics from scratch**, ensuring smooth and engaging gameplay.  

### 📊 Data Science & AI (Python, Machine Learning)  
- Developed **reinforcement learning models** to study AI behavior in simulations.  
- Built **predictive models** using **linear regression** and other ML techniques.  
- Applied **data analysis and visualization** for insights in various projects.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb Listings
  **Overview: Analyzing room types, pricing, availability, and location trends in Airbnb listings.**
          
  - Key Findings:
          
  - No expensive shared rooms: All shared rooms were affordable.
          
  - High-price areas: Mostly found in Brooklyn & Manhattan.
          
  - Availability & Price: No clear linear relationship.
          
   - NaN values: Only occurs in apartments with no reviews.

### 📈 LinearRegression Model on fuel consumption
**A simple but effective machine learning model.**  
- Developed a **linear regression model** analyzing **fuel consumption vs engine size**.
- As engine size increases the fuel consumption in city also increases.
- As engine size increases the fuel consumption in highway doesn't necessarily increase.
