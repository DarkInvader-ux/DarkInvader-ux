# Hello there, I'm **Alp** ‚Äì a passionate software developer based in **Barcelona, Spain**. I‚Äôm always grinding away at enhancing my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills through exciting projects and collaborative work. I‚Äôm a go-getter who loves to take on new challenges and learn from every experience.


## üíª Skills & Technologies

- **Programming Languages:** C#, Python
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Unity, Unreal (for game projects), Git & GitHub
- **Areas of Interest:** System Design, Digital Game Design, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis

## üöÄ Popular Projects

- [**SystemDesignProject**](https://github.com/DarkInvader-ux/SystemDesignProject)  
  *This project simulates the hunting behavior of dragonfly larvae using the Vivarium framework. The larvae navigate their environment, sensing and chasing tadpoles. If a larvae fails to eat for 10 seconds, it dies and is removed from the simulation.

    Features:
  
    ‚úÖ AI-driven predator-prey interaction
  
    ‚úÖ Real-time movement and decision-making
  
    ‚úÖ Asynchronous hunger monitoring with auto-despawn
  
    ‚úÖ Custom scene configuration via YAML*

- [**ArduwandAcademy**](https://github.com/DarkInvader-ux/ArduwandAcademy)  
  *ArduwandAcademy is an interactive potion brewing game built in Unity, integrating gesture recognition, Arduino motion sensing, and machine learning. Players use hand gestures and a physical magic wand to mix ingredients and cast spells, creating potions of varying difficulty.*

- [**Little-Limos**](https://github.com/DarkInvader-ux/Little-Limos)  
  *Little Limos is a 3D puzzle game following the journey of a magnet cube trapped in an empty universe, navigating challenges through physics-based interactions and environmental puzzles.

   üîπ Key Features:

    3C Design Implementation ‚Äì Designed and refined Character, Camera, and Controls.
 
    Core Gameplay Mechanics ‚Äì Built from scratch to create an immersive puzzle experience.

    Technical & Level Design ‚Äì Ensured seamless integration of puzzles and mechanics.

    Custom Shaders ‚Äì Developed unique visual effects for a distinct artistic style.*

- [**Fun-Race-3D-Clone**](https://github.com/DarkInvader-ux/Fun-Race-3D-Clone)  
  *A 3D clone of a fun racing game showcasing my skills in game development using C#.*

- [**RL-Simulation**](https://github.com/DarkInvader-ux/RL-Simulation)  
  *Learning Algorithms and Norm Stability in the Dictator Game:

   This project explores how different reinforcement learning (RL) models influence the emergence and stability of altruistic social norms in a simulated Dictator Game. We compare three learning algorithms‚ÄîBush-Mosteller, Q-Learning, and     Actor-Critic‚Äîto analyze their impact on donation behaviour.

   The simulation runs in the following mode:

   Separate Environments: Each algorithm is tested in isolation to study its independent learning dynamics.

   Key metrics include average donation amount, convergence speed, and robustness to free-riders. Results show that while all models eventually favor self-interest, the Bush-Mosteller agent is consistently the most selfish, while Q-   Learning and Actor-Critic display more variability and adaptability.

  The insights from this project bridge behavioral economics and AI, providing a deeper understanding of how learning mechanisms shape social norms.*

- [**LinearRegression**](https://github.com/DarkInvader-ux/LinearRegression)  
  *A straightforward application of linear regression for analyzing fuel consumption vs. engine size.*
